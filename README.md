# 🐍 100 Python Programs — Semester 5 Practical Collection  

> “Code is like poetry — elegant, structured, and sometimes, quietly rebellious.”  

Welcome to my personal repository of **100 Python programs** — a culmination of my **Semester 5 journey**, countless cups of chai ☕, and a deep dive into the art of programming.  

This isn’t just a collection of codes.  
It’s a reflection of how I learned to think logically, debug patiently, and write programs that actually make sense.

## 🧭 Overview  

This repository contains **100+ Python programs** written as part of my **college practicals**.  
Each program focuses on a **specific concept** — from the absolute basics to some fairly advanced logic-building exercises.  

Whether you’re a beginner looking for examples or a student preparing for practicals, this repo has something for you.
